# Privacy

Here is the data we collect, as declared to Discord:

* Call information, including messages during a call, channel/guild IDs, and IDs of users who initiated and picked up calls, are collected to facilitate calls and to combat abuse.
  * Message contents are never retained after being routed in a call.
  * Message IDs can be stored for up to 48 hours.
  * Everything else is retained indefinitely.
* For economy features, user IDs are kept indefinitely.
  * Users that initiate [Discoin](https://discoin.gitbooks.io) transactions (through the `>convert` command) will have their user ID transmitted to Discoin servers, which retain transaction records indefinitely.
* When a new number is registered in a server, channel and guild IDs, as well as the IDs of the owners of the respective guilds, are kept indefinitely to facilitate calls and to combat abuse.
  * Similarly, when a new number is registered in a DM, the user and DM channel IDs are kept indefinitely.
  * You may remove such data by `>dial *611` and ask for the number to be removed.
* For the blacklist, user and guild IDs are kept indefinitely to prevent rulebreakers from using the bot.

Furthermore:

* Parts of the aforementioned data (excluding messages) are also displayed publicly in #bot-log of the [support server](https://discord.gg/RN7pxrB), except certain call-related info of [VIP numbers](./VIP-Numbers).
* In addition, should you have a number in your server, any Customer Support member can summon an invite and join your server whenever we deem necessary.
* Privacy concerns should be directed to Customer Support (`>dial *611`) who will respond within 24 hours. If you're not satisfied with the response, please contact the developers at `dtel@austinhuang.me`.

The data is stored on a server owned by SunburntRock89#6617.
